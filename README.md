In this project I used Python to create a replica of one of the most popular and widely used Web Browsers, Google. The programming language used in my project is Python and the IDE used is Pycharm. 

The Web browser has these user interface elements in common.
 
Back and forward buttons to go back to the previous resource and forward
again.
 
A refresh or reload button to reload the current resource.
 
A stop button to cancel loading the resource. In some browsers, the stop
button is merged with the reload button.
 
A home button to return to the user's home page
 
An address bar to input the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) of the desired
resource and display it.
